# Endeavour Rover Workspace

This repository serves as a pseudo-metapackage. All packages used by the Endeavour Rover are linked as Git submodules.

This repository contains no actual code and contains primarily documentation. Individual packages may contain their own documentation, but information relevant to the operation of the full Endeavour Rover should be contained in this repository.
